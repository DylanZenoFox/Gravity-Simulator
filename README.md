# Gravity-Simulator
Gravity simulator with the ability to add point masses with or without initial velocities and allow them to interact.

-Make sure to run GravityGUI to begin appliction.

-Click on the window to add point masses.

-Drag point masses to add an inital velocity.

-Press start to begin simulation and stop to freeze it.

-While stopped, you can still add point masses with velocities.

-Change the final constant CUSTOM to change static custom enviroment elements ( 1 - One Black Hole; 2 - Two Black Holes ; 0 - No Black Holes)

-Look in code for ability to change mass of black holes and points as well as size and the Gravitational Constant G.

-Click remove all moving masses to remove all masses which were added to the map. (Not custom elements)

-I made it so points do not interact when they are overlapping, for accelerations tended towards infinity and they would fly away.

-Change boolean values in the creation of point masses to allow for points to destroy each other, interact with each other, and move.


-Set CUSTOM to 0 to view point masses interact with each other.

-Set CUSTOM to 1 to view point masses orbit a more massive body.  (WARNING: Must add initial velocity to avoid immediate destruction of point.)

-Set CUSTOM to 2 to view point masses in dual static black hole system.
